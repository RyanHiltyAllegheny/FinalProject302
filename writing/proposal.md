302 Project Proposal
27th Wednesday, October 

	The knowledge of being able to build and interact with online platforms is a skill that separates individuals in the workforce. Much of the information we consume comes from sources online, whether that be a website, database, platform, etc. The opportunity for the individuals with these skills are higher as these skills are being more demanded across the entire workforce. Give any business as an example, online marketing has become a huge market for businesses to advertise their product or service knowing it will reach millions of consumers. There are no limitations when it comes to possessing this type of skill. For my project I want to build off of an idea that was presented in the assignment description. The theme is listed below but I want to make a minor change to my idea.

	This class has 
	- **International Art Museum**: Develop an extension of the "art store" project
  described in Sections 3.7, 4.8, and 7.9. Your web site should feature examples
  of international art and then descriptions of both the artists who created the
  work and the art itself. Your site should feature a responsive layout displays
  both the art and the textual content on laptops, desktops, and mobile devices.
  Whenever possible, the site should support user interactivity through, for
  instance, an art discussion board or a background choice for the featured
  artwork.

	This idea I think would be great as it is a very visual appeal. The art component requires skills to make sure the web page is eye catching. The small twist I would like to throw on this page would be instead of an art museum, it would be a music museum. This is an idea I have had since we had started discussing the final project. There is some motive behind this project. A fellow student and I have a hobby of making and sharing playlists of different styles and genres of music. I would style the website to have pictures of albums and artists with interactive links to specific album and artist pages with active links to playlists on spotify. Using cool features on spotify I believe I will be able to link the playlists into the webpage through an image link instead of a basic text link. There is a lot of opportunity with this project and I feel my twist on this idea finds a great realistic ground that I could complete this project on.
